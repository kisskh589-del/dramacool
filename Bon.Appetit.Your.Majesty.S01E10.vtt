00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.966
BON APPÉTIT, YOUR MAJESTY

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.397 line:20%
I see you are here.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.047
What is taking her so long?

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.181
<i>Everyone.</i>

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.809
We must go and tell His Majesty.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.771
Or she is going to die!

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.983
But His Highness has become unconscious.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.110
This is beyond anything we can do.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.695
We should not get involved rashly.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.782
That is exactly how
the former chief royal cook met his end.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.492
They will make up crimes
she did not commit if they must.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:01.621
Then are you saying
we just sit back and do nothing?

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.918
How could you all be like this?

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.922
If you will just sit here and do nothing,

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.173
I will go on my own.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.217
I will go to His Majesty.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.720
No.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.264
You stay here.

00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:21.516
I will go.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:23.434
Cook Maeng.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.229
Cook Maeng…

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.731
Fine. I might as well.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.152
I will come as well.
No, I will lead the way.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.571
Let us try.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:35.697
Yes, I will join too.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.744
- Eunuch Yoon.
- Greetings.

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.830
Eunuch Yoon!

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:45.999
- Our miss…
- What is going on?

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.709
Our miss is…

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.426
How pleased will she be

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.595
when she sees this?

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:00.763
GOCHO

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.310
I cannot wait to see the look on her face.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.235
If she jumps into my arms like last time…

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:17.697
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.929
I believe this was the stance.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.307
This time,

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.809
I will not fall over.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.019
Your Majesty!

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:50.855
Your Majesty.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:52.482
Yes.

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.860
- Is she here?
- The chief royal cook

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.197
was tortured and imprisoned.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.075
The chief royal cook was tortured?

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.826
What on earth are you saying?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.248
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is on the verge of death.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.332
Jinmyeong?

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:14.963
<i>He fell ill after he ate</i>
<i>the chief royal cook's chicken dish,</i>

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.090
<i>so the Queen Dowager is furious.</i>

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.467
<i>She interrogated</i>
<i>the chief royal cook herself</i>

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.469
<i>and then threw her into prison.</i>

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:25.139
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.151
Cook Yeon.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:47.870
Open the door immediately.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.456
Your Majesty, with all due respect…

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.251
How dare you?
Open the door right this instant!

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:57.463
I wish I could,
but Her Royal Highness took the key.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.466
What did you say?

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.264
Commander.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.600
Break down this door!

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:10.893
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.478
Your Majesty.

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:21.404
I am sure you have heard by now.

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:22.822
QUEEN DOWAGER JAHYEON
YI HEON'S STEPMOTHER

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.825
My son Jinmyeong
ate the food that wench made

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.328
and now lingers on the brink of death.

00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:32.248
What in the world are you saying?

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.463
I also ate the chicken
the chief royal cook prepared.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.840
That is why I find it
even more suspicious.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.050
What?

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.552
Are you implying
that I was behind all this?

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:45.511
If only

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.308
I had questioned it
when you were so kind to my son,

00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.642
if I had prevented it,

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.729
then perhaps this would not
have happened to my Jinmyeong.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.775
Why would I do such a thing
when I have no reason to fear him?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.403
If something unfortunate
were to happen to you,

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:06.616
Jinmyeong would take the throne,
and maybe that is what you fear!

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.289
I dare you to say that again.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.917
At last, you show your true colors.

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:17.627
Say it again!

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.299
Hand over the key.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.052
It is a royal command.

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.473
You will not have it
as long as I am breathing.

00:06:31.682 --> 00:06:32.725
Kill me.

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:35.228
I said it was a royal command!

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:36.854
Your Majesty!

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.399
Please. Your Majesty.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:43.945
Your Majesty.

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.989
Calm down.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.783
You must not do this.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:52.578
What are you all doing?

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:53.704
Cover her immediately!

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.254
Put the sword down.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:04.590
You're not helping me by doing this.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.262
You know better than anyone
that I wouldn't do such a thing.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:10.972
So…

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.308
So put down the sword,

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.478
and please prove my innocence.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.736
<i>You must never</i>

00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:28.364
<i>become a tyrant.</i>

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:34.704
COURSE N° 10 JOSEON RESTAURANT

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.343
If we must become political enemies

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.180
just because we are blood-related…

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:57.351
then it is only right
that I put an end to it all right now.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.395
Your Majesty.

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.272
I know what happens here.

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.815
I know the future.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.735
If you use that sword now,

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.612
everything will get out of control.

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:11.908
The situation is already past
the point of control.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.284
No.

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.119
Nothing has happened yet.

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:17.288
Put down the sword.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.583
And no matter what happens,

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.044
you must restrain yourself.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.546
You must stand strong.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.674
Please leave. Now.

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.093
If I leave now…

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.805
you will die.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.935
If you do this, everyone will die!

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:42.021
Do you want me to hang myself right now?

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.731
Will you believe me if I do that?

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:54.700
<i>Believe me.</i>

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.302
To think that you, Queen Dowager,

00:09:15.763 --> 00:09:18.599
who always seemed on my side
and embraced me with your kind grace,

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:23.229
had been harboring such a different heart.

00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:27.149
I now realize what truly lies beneath

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.402
your benevolent facade.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.990
I, myself,
will get to the bottom of this incident.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:37.910
If you torture the chief royal cook again
before the truth is out,

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.913
there will be hell to pay.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.207
Very well.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.836
However, if something
were to happen to Jinmyeong before then,

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.547
I will see to it that the wench pays.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:55.720
If you wish to punish her,

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.973
you will have to dethrone me first.

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:12.695
Your Majesty.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.156
You must have been scared.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:17.742
It must have been hard.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:22.788
You must stay strong.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.583
Okay.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.295
You have to remember

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.798
what I said.

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:34.884
All right.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.511
I will not forget it.

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:44.018 line:20%
<i>Your Royal Highness,</i>

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:46.937
it appears His Majesty
has set forth plans in secret.

00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.397
Brother.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.484
How could you utter such disloyal words?

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:54.570 line:20%
I did not tell you
to spare you from the concern,

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.239
but Principal Drafter Yi
of the Office of Royal Decrees

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.993 line:20%
is looking for the draft of the record
that details how the deposed queen passed.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:02.495
The draft of the historical record

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:05.289
that details
how His Majesty's mother passed?

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:07.583
If His Majesty is looking for the draft

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.211
with the knowledge
that we were involved in her death,

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:12.922
would it not be
so that he can oust our Han family

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:15.257
that put him on the throne?

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.219
I believe this is connected

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:20.471
to what happened
to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:22.515
No.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.227 line:20%
Brother, think back
to the Muin Literati Purge.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.686 line:20%
OPPRESSION OF SARIM FACTION SCHOLARS
IN THE 4TH YEAR OF YEONHUIGUN'S REIGN

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.524
His Majesty is someone who would
make pretenses to exile individuals.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.360
He is not one to scheme or plot.

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:37.613
And to use poison of all things?

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.910
This is not His Majesty's doing.

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:48.040
Not to mention, His Majesty has changed
since the chief royal cook came here.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:51.043
He has become a different person.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:56.424
Will you believe me only after
the other princes fall unconscious?

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.886
The only one to escape this crisis

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:05.891
will be the idiotic Grand Prince Jesan.

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:09.103
Jesan…

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:11.564
<i>Grand Prince Jesan…</i>

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:12.690
GRAND PRINCE JESAN
SUPERINTENDENT OF SAONGWON

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.901
Her Grace Consort Kang

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.195
has contributed a great deal to our plan.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.116
What happened to Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is unfortunate,

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.785
but the Grand Royal Queen Dowager
and her Han relatives

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:28.497
will not be able to avoid
clashing with His Majesty.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.748
If His Majesty

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.960
eradicates the Han family
that has long served him,

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:36.881
that will be our chance
to claim the cause to oust a tyrant

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:40.092
and turn our swords against him.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.218
Your Highness.

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:45.598
Why are you allowing
that enemy Yi Jang-gyun to live?

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:48.017
He led the men who massacred
our tutors and brothers

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.852
who were in hiding during the last purge.

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:50.895
Regardless,

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.898
he still has a role to play.

00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:54.982
We still

00:12:55.983 --> 00:12:57.568
need him alive.

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:01.071
I do hope Grand Prince Jinmyeong

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.240
does not regain consciousness.

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.450
It does not matter now.

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:09.788
His Majesty and the chief royal cook
will not be able to avoid

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.458
this arrow of fate.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.340
I understand why the Queen Dowager
caused a scene out of fury,

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:20.758
but Cook Yeon had no reason

00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.343
to harm the Grand Prince
she had just met today.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:27.056
Find out if Grand Prince Jinmyeong
ate anything else

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.557
after the meal with me,

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:32.061
whom he met, and where he went.

00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:34.730
Look into every detail and report to me.

00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.065
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.591
Your Majesty, please take a look at this.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.385
What is this?

00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:05.678
It is the log from the dispensary.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:46.260
We also ate the chicken
His Majesty and His Highness ate,

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:48.554
but none of us suffered in any way.

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:51.682
I even ate an extra leg in secret,
and I am perfectly fine.

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:54.143
I ate some of the skin,
but nothing happened to me.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:56.562
My problem is that I have too much energy.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:58.939
The ingredients are clearly not to blame.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:01.233
The royal physician
will check every ingredient.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.819
Inform me immediately
if anything else comes to mind.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.158
Your Majesty,

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:11.035
I spoke to those at the royal kitchen,

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:12.328
and those at Naeuiwon, Royal Clinic,

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.789
carefully inspected all the ingredients
used in the roasted <i>ogolgye,</i>

00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:18.042
and they did not find anything unusual.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.378
I knew it.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:24.048
You can see that I am fine.

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:29.845
Could Grand Prince Jinmyeong
be suffering from something else?

00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.097
What makes you think that?

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:33.641
The royal physician said

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:36.852
his symptoms only arise
when one ingests poison,

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.939
but he did not take anything poisonous.

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:44.485
How about you visit

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:47.071
the quarters of the Queen Dowager
and check on His Highness?

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:58.666
How is he?

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.709
GRAND PRINCE JINMYEONG
YI HEON'S HALF-BROTHER

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.711
Your Royal Highness.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.546
I apologize.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.591
What a disaster this is.

00:16:07.675 --> 00:16:09.927
How could the heavens be so cruel?

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:14.390
His Majesty the King has arrived.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.400
Is he recovering?

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:27.319
We are searching for a cure.

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.405
I apologize for the delay, Your Majesty.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.201
What could have possibly
made you come to my quarters,

00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:35.995
which is usually
the least of your concerns?

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:39.456
You speak out of line,
Your Royal Highness.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.625
Your Majesty.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:43.752
What brings you here?

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:48.007
The royal physician examined all the food
Grand Prince Jinmyeong consumed that day

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.010
but did not find
anything unusual about it.

00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:56.557
Is what His Majesty said true?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.893
Yes, Your Royal Highness. It is true.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.895
I also looked into

00:17:01.979 --> 00:17:04.440
who Grand Prince Jinmyeong met
in the last fortnight,

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:08.902
but I was told he was always here with you
under your care.

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.362
That is why I came to see you.

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:20.080
That is why
I blame the food he ate that day.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.138
What are those medicinal herbs?

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:40.476
They are herbs
used in the restorative medicine

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.437
that His Highness takes regularly
due to his poor health.

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:46.315
Restorative medicine?
What is that doing here?

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:49.485
Grand Prince Jesan, the Superintendent
of Saongwon, Office of Royal Meals,

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:52.237
personally sends the herbs
every fortnight.

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.990
Then I inspect the contents here

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:58.160
and have them sent to Naeuiwon
to prepare the medicine to be brewed.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.787
I must take them with me.

00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:03.290
I will inspect them myself.

00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:04.583
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.044
Chang-seon.

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:09.171
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:12.299
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.302
I doubt there will be
anything wrong with it.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:18.806
Do you really think Grand Prince Jesan
would send the wrong herbs?

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:20.349
Your Majesty.

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.935
The reason
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's life is at risk

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.187
is because of that
wretched chief royal cook.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.396
Your Royal Highness.

00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:29.024
Mind your words.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.863
If word of this
were to spread outside the palace,

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.407
what would that do
to the reputation of the royal family?

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.090
Your Royal Highness.

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:55.300
Are you all right?

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.513
I am so afraid of His Majesty.

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.223
I…

00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:05.144
do not fear him anymore.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.521
The day my son dies,

00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:10.274
the chief royal cook and His Majesty

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.402
will both pay dearly.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.237
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.198
Your Royal Highness,
it is I, Court Lady Kim.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.123
What is it?

00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:27.708
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager

00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.044
has sent me to get the key to the prison
where the chief royal cook is being held.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:34.047
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager sent you?

00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:35.799
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.150
Does something concern you, Your Majesty?

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.574
What am I to do
if nothing is wrong with the herbs either?

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:02.993
Cook Yeon is not well.

00:20:03.702 --> 00:20:06.580
To think that she must be
suffering in that cold prison

00:20:06.663 --> 00:20:08.332
weighs on my heart.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.084
I cannot stand it.

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:12.502
I sent Eunuch Yoon

00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:15.088
to check on her
in the morning and evening,

00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.550
and she is doing well and staying strong,
saying that it is where she stayed

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.552
when she first came to the palace.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.888
You need not worry too much, Your Majesty.

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:24.431
What do you mean it is where she stayed?

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:29.603
I am talking about the prison
you had specially arranged for her

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.355
when she first came to the palace,
Your Majesty.

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:34.691
Think of it as a basic rule
to survive in the palace.

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.444
<i>I will prepare</i>
<i>a special residence for you.</i>

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.864
Do you still remember such a thing?

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:42.741
That is not like you.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:45.494
However,

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:47.788
things are different now.

00:20:48.538 --> 00:20:50.123
If I leave her be,

00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:52.334
her life will not be worth living.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:56.546
<i>What must I do?</i>

00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.425
<i>What must I do to save you?</i>

00:21:08.392 --> 00:21:11.728
<i>Where on earth is my </i>Mangunrok<i>?</i>

00:21:13.563 --> 00:21:17.609
How did I end up in Joseon
only to suffer such hardships?

00:21:20.195 --> 00:21:22.030
I want to go home so badly.

00:21:30.163 --> 00:21:32.833
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager has arrived.

00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.463
Over here. I'm in here.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.307
I thought you would be struggling,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.767
but I see you have managed to adapt
even in this place.

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:56.273
Gil-geum and I stayed here for a while,

00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:57.816
so I'm used to it.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.527
I will ask you just one thing.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.323
Did you truly try to kill
the Grand Prince?

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.783
No.

00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:10.746
Please don't tell me
you also believe that.

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:13.457
Then did His Majesty put you up to it?

00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.793
What are you saying?

00:22:16.877 --> 00:22:18.879
You know what he's like.

00:22:18.962 --> 00:22:20.547
If he wanted someone dead,
he'd do it himself.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.093
You must keep your wits sharp.

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:28.138
His Majesty is under suspicion
because of you.

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:31.141
If this continues,

00:22:31.641 --> 00:22:34.144
he will end up in grave danger.

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:36.188
His Majesty will be in danger?

00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:40.275
All kinds of malicious rumors
are running rampant throughout the palace.

00:22:40.942 --> 00:22:43.236
They say Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is on the verge of death

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.865
because you, the chief royal cook,
poisoned his food.

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.993
They say His Majesty's judgment
has been clouded

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.497
because he keeps
the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook too close to him.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:57.250
If you fail to prove your innocence,

00:22:57.334 --> 00:23:00.087
you will be tortured at Uigeumbu,
State Tribunal,

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:04.341
for attempting to murder a grand prince
and die amid great suffering.

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:08.136
So much so that you would
want to take your own life.

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.140
If I get you out of here,

00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.226
can you find evidence

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.269
to prove your innocence?

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:20.357
If you do,

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:23.860
I promise to find evidence,
no matter what.

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:26.571
If you fail to prove your innocence…

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.204
you must put an end to it

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:36.456
yourself.

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:49.177
It's a real silver dagger.

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:54.516
I will give you three days.

00:23:57.894 --> 00:23:58.728
You must

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.022
find evidence.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.610
Yes, I will.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:16.413
Is that His Majesty's <i>natgeotsang,</i>
daytime meal?

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.375
- Oh my goodness!
- Miss!

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.502
- My goodness. What happened?
- Miss!

00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:24.462
- Oh my goodness.
- Miss!

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.923
- My gosh!
- Look how haggard you have become!

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:28.508
Just a moment!

00:24:29.092 --> 00:24:30.802
I'll explain everything later.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:32.971
Let me serve the <i>natgeotsang </i>first.

00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:33.889
Sure.

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:36.558
Cook Maeng,
put the rest of the <i>jeon </i>on the table.

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:38.602
Cook Sim and Cook Min,
get the other side dishes.

00:24:38.685 --> 00:24:40.353
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.148
- Hurry!
- Okay.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:58.622
Your Majesty, your <i>natgeotsang</i> is ready.

00:24:58.705 --> 00:25:01.291
I do not want it. Take it away.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.836
Your Majesty, I told you many times.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.671
You shouldn't skip your meals.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:08.590
Chief Royal Cook?

00:25:11.593 --> 00:25:13.803
Am I hearing things again?

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.565
Your Majesty.

00:25:27.317 --> 00:25:28.360
Cook Yeon.

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:33.698
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:38.995
I missed you so much.

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:44.501
How did you get out?

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:48.296
<i>All kinds of malicious rumors</i>
<i>are running rampant throughout the palace.</i>

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.715
They say His Majesty's judgment
has been clouded

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.677
because he keeps
the <i>gwinyeo</i> cook too close to him.

00:25:57.639 --> 00:25:58.515
Your Majesty.

00:25:59.766 --> 00:26:02.060
You don't seem to understand,
so let me make it very clear.

00:26:03.853 --> 00:26:09.025
There are misunderstandings
and absurd rumors going around the palace

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:13.071
because you keep hugging
and kissing a woman you don't even like.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.838
I'll explain everything

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.465
while you have your--

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:37.470
What are you doing?

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:40.432
That was

00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:44.144
for the woman I cherish the most.

00:26:44.978 --> 00:26:46.146
That was my kiss.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.888
Try it.

00:27:33.234 --> 00:27:34.527
Try this too.

00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:36.571
Very well.

00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:47.540
This too.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.168
Cook Yeon.

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:51.711
Eat with me today.

00:27:52.796 --> 00:27:53.630
Pardon?

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.175
Your Majesty, that'd be inappropriate.

00:27:58.593 --> 00:28:00.220
Are you talking back to me?

00:28:01.346 --> 00:28:02.806
No, but…

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.060
Then eat.

00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:11.773
Go on.

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:14.484
Okay.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.294
You appear to have become rather haggard.

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:36.214
Please make sure to eat your meals.

00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:39.634
I could say the same about you.

00:28:47.642 --> 00:28:48.560
Tell me.

00:28:49.644 --> 00:28:50.937
How did you get out?

00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:53.898
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager released me.

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:55.191
After you eat,

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.069
we must uncover the truth together.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:28:59.821
Uncover the truth

00:29:00.488 --> 00:29:01.698
together?

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.199
Yes.

00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.909
The Grand Royal Queen Dowager let me out

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:08.496
on the condition
that I do that within three days.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.585
What kind of silly promise is that?

00:29:20.341 --> 00:29:22.260
It's more serious than you think.

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:29.017
Forget what you promised my grandmother.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.560
Do you think I would let you die?

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.233
Your Majesty.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.029
Do you really like me?

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.625
Do you really have feelings for me?

00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:00.548
You should eat.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.096
Her Royal Highness

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.434
is concerned that foul rumors about us
are going around the palace.

00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:12.977
From now on,

00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:15.980
you can't do what you did to me earlier.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.565
In that case,

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:20.109
tell me in detail

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.153
what I can and cannot do.

00:30:23.238 --> 00:30:24.322
Do you really not know?

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:27.033
You can't do anything
without my permission, okay?

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.078
Be more specific.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:32.664
Well…

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:36.084
Hugging me wherever you please,
calling me out at night,

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:39.879
getting drunk and kissing me,

00:30:39.963 --> 00:30:41.214
or doing what you did earlier…

00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:42.674
Anyway, you can't do any of that.

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:51.307
How very silly.

00:30:51.391 --> 00:30:52.475
Silly?

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:55.603
I'm being serious here,
and you call it silly?

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:56.729
Yes.

00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:59.232
Do you want some rice punch?

00:30:59.315 --> 00:31:00.233
No.

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:01.860
Don't mind me,
who focuses on silly things.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:03.945
Do not be like that.

00:31:04.654 --> 00:31:05.530
Here.

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.365
Drink it.

00:31:09.742 --> 00:31:10.743
Go on.

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:25.091
The cooks have gotten much better.

00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:36.269
The old hag released the chief royal cook?

00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:37.395
KANG MOK-JU
FOURTH JUNIOR CONSORT, YI HEON'S CONCUBINE

00:31:37.478 --> 00:31:39.355
She must have gone senile.

00:31:39.439 --> 00:31:41.816
She has only earned
three more days to live.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.276
Three days, you say?

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:46.696
Will the chief royal cook
find evidence first,

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:49.115
or will Grand Prince Jinmyeong die first?

00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:51.868
I guess it would not be so bad
to stand by and watch.

00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:58.291
If you have something on your mind,
do tell.

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.086
Why did you release the chief royal cook

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.881
when you should have tortured
the truth out of her?

00:32:04.964 --> 00:32:06.507
Release her?

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:09.344
Do you still not see
what His Majesty is thinking?

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:12.931
He is searching for an excuse
to exterminate our Han family.

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:17.435
We cannot be sure of that.

00:32:17.518 --> 00:32:21.397
Whatever the case, we need His Majesty
to remain on the throne.

00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:24.317
That is of grave importance to our family.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.985
Just wait and see

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:29.697
what the chief royal cook will do

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:34.202
if she cannot find evidence
within three days.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.704 line:20%
DAY 1 OF THE INVESTIGATION

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:37.664 line:20%
Look at this.

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.291 line:20%
Ginkgo nuts, chestnuts, jujube.

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:43.294
None of the ingredients in your dish
were unfamiliar to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:44.921
Then could it be the butter…

00:32:45.004 --> 00:32:47.423
- I mean, could it be the <i>suyu</i>?
- <i>Suyu</i>?

00:32:47.507 --> 00:32:52.261
After eating it, did he seem dizzy
or develop any rashes?

00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.846
I am not certain about rashes.

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.058
Can eating a lot of ginseng make you ill?

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:59.435
I used ginseng to cook the meal.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.771
<i>Eating too much of it</i>

00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:04.065
can cause headaches or sleeplessness,

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.693
but it would not cause one
to become unconscious.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.445
<i>I tasted the ingredients</i>
<i>of Jinmyeong's medicine.</i>

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:11.155
<i>What is the one that tastes rather odd?</i>

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:12.573
Could that be musk?

00:33:12.657 --> 00:33:13.908
It was not musk.

00:33:13.992 --> 00:33:16.744
<i>They were small and round,</i>
<i>almost bean-like,</i>

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.287
<i>with a foul taste.</i>

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:19.330
Your Majesty.

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:22.625
It is normal for restorative medicine
to taste bitter and foul.

00:33:22.709 --> 00:33:26.421
The bitterness was unlike
any of the other ingredients.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:32.301 line:20%
DAY 2 OF THE INVESTIGATION

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:39.976
Your Majesty.

00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:49.318 line:20%
What did the maids who cleaned out
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's chamber pot say?

00:33:49.402 --> 00:33:54.323 line:20%
They said there was nothing unusual
about his fecal matter.

00:33:54.407 --> 00:33:55.908
I apologize for the bad news,
Your Majesty.

00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:10.673
My gosh, miss. You are finally back.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.344
What should I do?

00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.014
No matter how hard I look,
there's no hope.

00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:20.016
It is the second day already.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.021
Anyway, what is in here?

00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:29.859
Ingredients of Grand Prince Jinmyeong's
restorative medicine and food records.

00:34:29.942 --> 00:34:31.110
I see.

00:34:31.194 --> 00:34:33.279
Let me see. Goodness.

00:34:36.115 --> 00:34:39.202
They are incredibly precious herbs.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.331
What could this smell be?

00:34:44.957 --> 00:34:46.918
Why? Does it smell strange?

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:52.381
Miss, this smells of rats.
They must have nibbled on them.

00:34:52.465 --> 00:34:54.092
Come on, that's ridiculous.

00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:57.678
They wouldn't have let rats
eat His Highness' medicine.

00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:01.724
This is definitely
the smell of rat droppings.

00:35:01.808 --> 00:35:02.725
Is it?

00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:08.815
It does smell revolting.

00:35:10.233 --> 00:35:11.234 line:20%
DAY 3 OF THE INVESTIGATION

00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:15.238 line:20%
So Grand Prince Jinmyeong
has never been picky about food?

00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:18.199
That is right.
He is not a picky eater like His Majesty,

00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.368
and he has never suffered
such a high fever before.

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:24.163
Maybe the chicken dish
did not cause the illness after all.

00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:27.583
Other than my food, the only thing he had
was his usual restorative medicine.

00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:29.752
Chief Royal Cook.

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.546
You must hurry to His Majesty's quarters.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:34.048
His Majesty has suddenly collapsed.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.216
His Majesty?

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.885
Your Majesty,
the chief royal cook is here.

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:41.305
Your Majesty, are you all right?

00:35:43.224 --> 00:35:44.350
You are here.

00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:47.186
Do not cause a fuss.

00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:50.356
Is he all right?

00:35:50.439 --> 00:35:53.693
His Majesty has had
a lot on his mind lately,

00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:55.695
and that seems to have exhausted him.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.575
Wait.

00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:04.120
Does His Majesty have a fever?

00:36:04.203 --> 00:36:06.080
How did you know that?

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:10.835
Aren't his symptoms similar
to those of Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:20.386
Now that you mention it, it is strange.

00:36:20.469 --> 00:36:21.762
Why do I have

00:36:22.722 --> 00:36:24.724
the same symptoms as Jinmyeong?

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:28.436
You tasted the medicinal herbs
during the investigation.

00:36:29.145 --> 00:36:32.273
If you have a fever like the Grand Prince,

00:36:32.815 --> 00:36:34.525
then his illness…

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:39.280
Could it be related to
one of the medicinal herbs?

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:40.948
To a medicinal herb?

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:42.533
Yes.

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:43.784
His Majesty said

00:36:43.868 --> 00:36:46.662
one of them had a foul taste,

00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:47.622
and Gil-geum said

00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:50.750
it smelled like rat droppings.

00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:55.129
But musk and milkvetch root
do not have a foul taste,

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.839
and while the other medicinal herbs
might smell musty,

00:36:56.923 --> 00:36:59.342
they don't smell like rat droppings.

00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:02.303
The smell of rat droppings
and a foul taste…

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.264
Could it be…

00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:07.892 line:20%
<i>oryeongji</i>?

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.855
What is that?

00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.815
In China, there are flying squirrels

00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:16.567
that glide using their skin
stretched between their limbs.

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:19.528
The feces of flying squirrels
that have been prepared for medicinal use

00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:21.781
is called <i>oryeongji</i>.

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:23.866
By "feces," you mean…

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:25.618
Rat droppings?

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:31.582
That is why it tasted so disgusting.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.586
Then does the medicine contain <i>oryeongji</i>?

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.422
I will have to check to be sure,

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:42.051
but I do not believe <i>oryeongji</i> is included
in His Highness' medicinal herbs.

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:46.639
Also, <i>oryeongji</i> is not a poison
but a valuable medicinal ingredient.

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:49.934
Then is it not that either?

00:37:51.394 --> 00:37:54.563
Your Majesty, did you eat anything
other than the ginseng porridge

00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:55.982
from the royal kitchen today?

00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:58.484
What else would I have eaten?

00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:01.445
Ginseng.

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.865
When <i>oryeongji</i> is ingested with ginseng,

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.534
everything changes.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.703
How so?

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.246 line:20%
It becomes a<i> sangbanyak.</i>

00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:11.747 line:20%
In other words, poison.

00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:13.457 line:20%
Poison?

00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:16.168
Then could it cause death?

00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:19.255
Yes. If <i>oryeongji </i>and ginseng
are consumed together,

00:38:19.338 --> 00:38:20.840
it causes chills and a fever.

00:38:20.923 --> 00:38:24.051
If consumed in excess,
it could threaten one's life.

00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:28.681
Then isn't His Majesty's life
in danger too?

00:38:28.764 --> 00:38:32.476
Even if <i>oryeongji</i> were included
in the Grand Prince's medicine,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.270
His Majesty only tasted it,

00:38:34.353 --> 00:38:37.565
so his symptoms will disappear in time.

00:38:39.942 --> 00:38:41.110
That's a relief.

00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:43.654
If Jinmyeong is in such a critical state

00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:48.909
because he ate a chicken dish with ginseng
and the medicine with <i>oryeongji</i>…

00:38:51.078 --> 00:38:52.621
Is there an antidote?

00:38:52.705 --> 00:38:53.873
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:57.126
I can make an antidote.

00:38:57.209 --> 00:39:00.463
However, it will take some time.

00:39:00.546 --> 00:39:02.340
In that case, confirm the facts

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:05.176
and promptly make
an antidote for Jinmyeong.

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:06.552
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.310
Someone

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.396
poisoned him by cunning means.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.190
The culprit must be someone

00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:22.693
who knows that <i>oryeongji</i> and ginseng
become a poison when eaten together.

00:39:23.652 --> 00:39:24.612
Indeed.

00:39:25.738 --> 00:39:27.073
Chang-seon.

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:33.037
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.247
Send the Chief Royal Secretary to Naeuiwon

00:39:36.415 --> 00:39:39.460
and have him identify
who tampered with Jinmyeong's medicine.

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.795
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.385
My uncle manages the medicinal herbs,

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:49.678
so who would tamper with them?

00:39:50.805 --> 00:39:52.098
The culprit

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:54.475
must be someone close by.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.018
Think carefully, Your Majesty.

00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:03.567
Grand Prince Jinmyeong
will wake up soon, won't he?

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.363
It is all thanks to you.

00:40:08.364 --> 00:40:09.740
I'm relieved.

00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:14.578
Your Majesty, you should lie back down.

00:40:15.663 --> 00:40:16.497
Come on.

00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:28.467
Your Majesty.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.012
I told you not to do this
without my permission.

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:35.391
Let us allow just this.

00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:40.062
But if someone were to come in…

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:43.441
It is to cure my headache.

00:40:46.193 --> 00:40:47.236
Just for a while.

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.197
Stay here just a while.

00:41:05.754 --> 00:41:07.339
Greetings, Chief Royal Secretary.

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:10.801
Name every person who handled
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's medicine.

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:11.760
Yes, my lord.

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.223
A female physician named Eo Yeo-bun

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.350
was in charge of
the Grand Prince's medicine,

00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:20.519
but no one has seen her in days.

00:41:20.603 --> 00:41:23.105 line:20%
FEMALE PHYSICIAN EO YEO-BUN

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:24.607 line:20%
BREWED MEDICINE

00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:35.910
<i>What?</i>

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:38.662
The one who tampered with the medicine
is the female physician?

00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.873
Yes, Your Majesty.
She added <i>oryeongji </i>to the medicinal herbs

00:41:40.956 --> 00:41:43.209
and sent it
to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:45.169
However, Your Majesty,

00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:47.546
I went to look for her
upon hearing that she had gone missing,

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.590
but she had already fled.

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:53.469
Send the palace guards
to find her immediately.

00:41:53.552 --> 00:41:54.553
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:02.311
Can we find her by tomorrow?

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:05.022
The time I promised Her Royal Highness
is almost up.

00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:06.315
Do not worry.

00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:08.609
We found the culprit.

00:42:09.443 --> 00:42:12.738
Your innocence has now been proven.

00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:15.783
I will speak with my grandmother.

00:42:18.786 --> 00:42:21.539
Why do you think
the female physician did it?

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:26.710
In such matters as this,
there is always one who commands it.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.048
We must find the physician
if we are to find out who that is.

00:42:31.131 --> 00:42:33.801
How can we find someone
who went into hiding?

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.805
Finding someone in hiding?

00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:44.186
<i>Gong-gil is better at that</i>
<i>than any slave hunter.</i>

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.021
Find this physician.

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:47.690
You must find her tonight.

00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:48.732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.325
Your Grace, a message has arrived
from Grand Prince Jesan's residence.

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:01.620
Im Song-jae came to meet His Highness,
as he is the Superintendent of Saongwon,

00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.372
claiming to be looking for
a missing female physician.

00:43:03.455 --> 00:43:05.124
- What?
- That is not all.

00:43:05.207 --> 00:43:09.503
He used that as an excuse
to search His Highness' residence.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.049
Is it possible he has caught on?

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.801
I believe His Highness is under suspicion.

00:43:20.055 --> 00:43:20.889
Chu-wol.

00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:23.559
We must silence that female physician.

00:43:23.642 --> 00:43:24.476
Take care of it.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.186
Yes, Your Grace.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:30.274 line:20%
FORBIDDEN

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:32.693
My lady.

00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:35.696
You are here.
It must have been an arduous journey.

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:38.324
Is it all over?

00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:41.327
Can I return to Naeuiwon now?

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.244
Yes.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.497
However, we must go somewhere else first.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:47.833
Where is that?

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:52.796
The afterlife.

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.687
How dare you, you lowly jester.

00:44:09.271 --> 00:44:10.981
So you are the wench

00:44:11.565 --> 00:44:12.733
who killed my sister Ok-dan.

00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.027
What are you talking about?

00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:18.864
She had this in her hand when she died.

00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.286
It is your weapon.

00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:27.623
I cannot see clearly because it is dark.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.969
Oh, you are one nasty woman.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.721
You wench.

00:44:43.263 --> 00:44:45.307
You look a complete mess
with your hair in disarray.

00:44:46.809 --> 00:44:48.727
This damned wench.

00:44:49.603 --> 00:44:52.272
A rotten wench like you should go to hell!

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.942
You speak with a tongue
as foul as your lowly birth.

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:57.111
I will silence
that vulgar mouth of yours for good.

00:44:57.778 --> 00:44:59.446
Do you not fear the heavens?

00:45:02.908 --> 00:45:03.951
Very well.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:06.412
This is the day you die.

00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:26.932
Why did you kill my sister?

00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:28.559
Did the king command it
after he took her for <i>chaehong</i>?

00:45:28.642 --> 00:45:29.643
His Majesty?

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:32.813
You fool.

00:45:34.106 --> 00:45:35.649
Tell the truth!

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:38.110
Why? Do you want revenge?

00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:42.614
So you were the one
who has been trying to kill His Majesty.

00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:56.587
Tell me who ordered you to kill her.

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:59.214
Was it Kang Mok-ju or the king?

00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:01.258
Your tongue will be the death of you.

00:46:04.344 --> 00:46:07.598
This is where you die.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:19.526
I see it was Consort Kang's order.

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:22.321
All the court ladies at Jahongwon…

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:27.159
die when their use is done.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.536
Who says so?

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.914
Who gets to decide that?

00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.209
Why?

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.044
Why?

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.879
Why did you kill her?

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.105
Shall I tell you the truth before you die?

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.609
Your sister incurred
Her Grace's displeasure

00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:03.320
because she tried to win
His Majesty's favor.

00:47:04.863 --> 00:47:06.782
It must have been
for her starving brother.

00:47:07.366 --> 00:47:08.408
You took someone's life

00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:11.995
over such a trivial matter?

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:13.664
She died because of you.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:17.042
You do not deserve to be called humans!

00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:18.126
Die!

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.527
Look.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:44.903
Wake up.

00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:46.613
Do you hear me?

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.286
Please spare me.

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.162
I am sorry.

00:47:54.246 --> 00:47:57.207
Tell the truth, and I will spare you.

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.544
Did you tamper with

00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:02.588
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's medicine?

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:04.089
Yes.

00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:08.594
I was scared of Her Grace Consort Kang,
so I had no choice.

00:48:11.096 --> 00:48:12.681
The person behind it all

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.518
was Consort Kang, not the king.

00:48:17.603 --> 00:48:19.146
It was that sly wench.

00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.731
The truth is,

00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:25.277
there is someone behind Her--

00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:29.531
Who is there?

00:48:34.036 --> 00:48:36.038
I got rid of the female physician,

00:48:36.121 --> 00:48:39.374
but Gong-gil was incredibly skilled,

00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:42.753
so I was unable to take care of Chu-wol.

00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:44.713
Were you injured?

00:48:46.173 --> 00:48:47.341
It is nothing serious, Your Highness.

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.092
I see a mere jester

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.346
possesses great skill.

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.183
I will have Consort Kang
take care of Chu-wol.

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:59.353
Go to the butchers' village
and get Yi Jang-gyun right away.

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.063
Yes, Your Highness.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:12.574
No matter how much we torture her,

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:17.037
she insists she had nothing to do
with Grand Prince Jinmyeong's incident.

00:49:19.373 --> 00:49:23.001
Look up and face me, criminal.

00:49:25.587 --> 00:49:27.631
I heard you were
the inspector court lady at Jahongwon.

00:49:27.714 --> 00:49:29.257
Did Consort Kang put you up to it?

00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:31.760
No, Your Majesty.

00:49:31.843 --> 00:49:34.221
Her Grace knows nothing of it.

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.431
I had a personal grudge,

00:49:36.515 --> 00:49:38.600
and I did everything on my own.

00:49:38.684 --> 00:49:39.976
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

00:49:40.727 --> 00:49:42.312
- This is not getting anywhere.
- Please believe me.

00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:46.024
I will ask Consort Kang myself.

00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:50.612
Your Majesty!

00:49:51.363 --> 00:49:52.197
Your Majesty.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:54.241
Your Majesty!

00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:06.962
Chu-wol.

00:50:12.217 --> 00:50:13.844
His Majesty the King has--

00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:20.851
Your Majesty.

00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:22.477
Was it you?

00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:24.855
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:30.318
Not only did your trusted court lady
hide the physician who was involved

00:50:30.986 --> 00:50:32.738
in Grand Prince Jinmyeong's poisoning,

00:50:32.821 --> 00:50:34.364
but she was caught
trying to kill her as well.

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.825
Do you still plan to continue
to feign ignorance?

00:50:36.908 --> 00:50:40.287
I know nothing about that.

00:50:41.246 --> 00:50:42.581
Why did you do it?

00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:44.833
How can there be a reason
when I know nothing of the matter?

00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:46.460
Do you not believe me?

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.837
What do you gain from doing this?

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.630
I gain nothing.

00:50:50.714 --> 00:50:51.631
Actually,

00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:55.093
you came to see me
after a long while to wrongly accuse me,

00:50:55.177 --> 00:50:57.429
so perhaps that is a gain on my part.

00:50:57.512 --> 00:50:59.014
Do you truly…

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.476
wish to die?

00:51:04.644 --> 00:51:05.812
Your Majesty.

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:07.856
If you wish to punish me,

00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:11.109
bring forth the evidence.

00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:17.783
You committed a grave sin worthy of death.

00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:21.244
The least you should be doing
is pleading for your life.

00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:23.330
But very well.

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:25.081
I shall bring evidence.

00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:36.259 line:20%
GANGNYEONGJEON

00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:48.772
How did you know?

00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:52.025
I heard you told Gong-gil
that if he had the jesters

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.736
stir up a scene under the guise
of searching for the physician

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.321
while keeping an eye on Consort Kang,

00:51:58.198 --> 00:52:01.159
he would be able to locate the physician.

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:03.912
Gil-geum was attacked

00:52:03.995 --> 00:52:06.122
during the competition
against the cooks of the royal kitchen,

00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:07.958
and Gong-gil saved her.

00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.043
He said the attacker
was dressed like a court lady,

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:12.838
and I thought if anyone here
was brazen enough to do that,

00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:18.176
it would be Her Grace Consort Kang.

00:52:20.053 --> 00:52:22.556
Are you saying something similar
happened then too?

00:52:23.598 --> 00:52:24.516
Yes.

00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:28.353
Your Majesty, your medicine is here.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:42.659
Your Majesty.

00:52:42.742 --> 00:52:45.036
This is <i>cheongyeolyak</i>,
which will eliminate the toxic effects

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.705 line:20%
of <i>oryeongji </i>and ginseng.

00:52:46.788 --> 00:52:47.998 line:20%
CHEONGYEOLYAK:
HERBAL MEDICINE TO COUNTER A FEVER

00:52:48.623 --> 00:52:50.709
CHOI MAL-IM
KING'S SENIOR COURT LADY

00:53:01.595 --> 00:53:03.096
What about Grand Prince Jinmyeong?

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.265
Now that Your Majesty
has taken the medicine,

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:08.351
we will be serving it
to Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:12.147
I must be there to witness it.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.690
Your Majesty,

00:53:13.773 --> 00:53:17.193
you must rest
and recover from the effects.

00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:18.320
I am fine.

00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:20.572
Come with me.

00:53:20.655 --> 00:53:21.489
Yes.

00:53:33.752 --> 00:53:36.338
His Majesty the King has arrived.

00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:42.594
Your Majesty.

00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:49.601
The royal physician
has prepared an antidote.

00:53:49.684 --> 00:53:51.686
- <i>Cheongyeolyak</i>.
- Yes.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:55.732
It will help bring down
the excessively high fever.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.819
Hurry and give Jinmyeong the antidote.

00:54:01.696 --> 00:54:03.573
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:54:47.742 --> 00:54:48.827
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:51.204
Do you feel better?

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.081
This is such a relief.

00:54:53.164 --> 00:54:54.916
I am so glad.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.710
He is better at last.

00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:01.089
Grand Prince Jinmyeong!

00:55:01.172 --> 00:55:02.882
What is the matter?

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.009
Grand Prince!

00:55:04.509 --> 00:55:05.468
What is happening?

00:55:05.552 --> 00:55:07.512
He is having a seizure!

00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:09.973
Grand Prince Jinmyeong.

00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:15.478 line:20%
- Grand Prince.
- His pulse is fast and frail.

00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:18.815 line:20%
His body lacks the nutrition and energy
to take the medicine.

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:21.443
Prepare another medicine
to treat him immediately!

00:55:21.526 --> 00:55:25.447
What good is making more medicine
when he cannot even swallow?

00:55:26.781 --> 00:55:28.324
- Grand Prince Jinmyeong.
- Grand Prince!

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:29.784
- Grand Prince.
- Oh dear.

00:55:31.536 --> 00:55:32.495
<i>Could it be because…</i>

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:37.167
The reason the antidote isn't working

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.252
is because he hasn't been eating, right?

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:42.255
Yes. You could say that.

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:47.343
I will prepare some food to restore
Grand Prince Jinmyeong's energy.

00:55:49.554 --> 00:55:50.972
Are you planning to flee?

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.267
Queen Dowager.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.312
The royal physician
confirmed Jinmyeong's state

00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:59.397
was caused by a <i>sangbanyak</i>.

00:55:59.481 --> 00:56:02.150
The female physician
who was involved has died,

00:56:02.233 --> 00:56:06.446
but we apprehended a Jahongwon court lady
who tried to kill that physician.

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:10.116
So why do you still blame
the chief royal cook?

00:56:11.576 --> 00:56:12.452
Grandmother.

00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:17.582
The court lady is being interrogated,

00:56:17.665 --> 00:56:20.293
so we will soon find out
who was behind it.

00:56:20.919 --> 00:56:21.753
That is right.

00:56:21.836 --> 00:56:25.507
If the chief royal cook wanted to flee,
she would not have come here at all.

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.013
Go ahead.

00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:34.099
- Your Majesty!
- It is a royal command.

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:37.560
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:46.236
Jinmyeong.

00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:48.613
Please come to your senses, Jinmyeong.

00:56:53.493 --> 00:56:54.702
<i>If I'm right,</i>

00:56:54.786 --> 00:56:57.789
<i>Grand Prince Jinmyeong</i>
<i>is showing symptoms of hypoglycemic shock.</i>

00:56:57.872 --> 00:57:00.208
<i>In other words, malnutrition.</i>

00:57:00.291 --> 00:57:02.961
<i>I need to make a highly concentrated</i>
<i>nourishing dish that's easy to consume.</i>

00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:07.132
ROYAL KITCHEN

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:11.845
Attention, everyone!

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:15.598
- Chief Royal Cook!
- Miss! We were so worried about you.

00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:17.308
What happened?

00:57:17.392 --> 00:57:19.561
Sorry, Gil-geum. I'll explain later.

00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:22.355
We're going to make a nourishing dish.

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.190
A nourishing dish?
What kind and with what?

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:25.650
Carp? Eel?

00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:28.194
The dish is called "restaurant."

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.238
- "Resto…"
- "Restaro"?

00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:32.073
Res… What is it called again?

00:57:32.157 --> 00:57:33.616
There's no time, so we must hurry.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.536
Gil-geum, I need you to make
gourd-shaped rice cakes with white rice.

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.289
Cook Maeng,
please make <i>sujebi </i>dough with wheat flour.

00:57:39.372 --> 00:57:40.915
- Okay.
- Very well.

00:57:40.999 --> 00:57:42.000
We are making a nourishing dish.

00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:43.376
- Cook Min.
- Okay!

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.335
What shall I do?

00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:46.963
Can you get me the ox feet soup we made
for the <i>seoksura</i>, evening meal?

00:57:47.046 --> 00:57:47.964
- Okay.
- What about me?

00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:50.175
Can you go to the storage in Naeuiwon

00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:52.635
and get licorice, angelica root,
<i>cheongung</i> root, and velvet antler?

00:57:52.719 --> 00:57:53.845
Sure.

00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:17.118
Okay, nice.

00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:20.538
What kind of dish is this restoran?

00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:23.249 line:20%
It's a nourishing dish that got its name

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:25.793 line:20%
from the French word "<i>restaurer,</i>"
meaning "to restore."

00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:29.172 line:20%
We're making the Joseon version.

00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:32.550 line:20%
Oh, it is a Prance-style restoran.

00:58:32.634 --> 00:58:35.220
So it is not an ordinary <i>sujebi,</i>
hand-pulled dough.

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:39.265
It's nice and thick.

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.976
It is as thick as a sauce.

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.520
You know so much now.

00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:46.564 line:20%
This is a velouté sauce.

00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:48.650 line:20%
Blatty sauce?

00:58:48.733 --> 00:58:50.443
No, blotty sauce.

00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:52.237
- Velouté sauce.
- Velouté.

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.363
- Velou…
- Give me that.

00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:11.965
The chief royal cook has arrived.

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.345
I apologize for the delay.

00:59:17.428 --> 00:59:20.348
Please help him sit up so he can eat.

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:26.729
How can I trust what you made
and give it to my son?

00:59:30.275 --> 00:59:31.401
What is this?

00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:35.280
<i>It's a Joseon-style restaurant</i>
<i>with gourd-shaped rice cakes and </i>sujebi<i>.</i>

00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:37.365
Joseon-style "restoran"?

00:59:38.283 --> 00:59:39.867
Gourd-shaped rice cakes?

00:59:39.951 --> 00:59:41.744
How is this nourishing?

00:59:42.453 --> 00:59:44.914
Rice cakes and <i>sujebi</i>
made with wheat flour

00:59:44.998 --> 00:59:46.291
are rapidly digested
and absorbed into the body,

00:59:46.374 --> 00:59:48.543
so they can be fattening
to ordinary people.

00:59:49.043 --> 00:59:50.920
But Grand Prince Jinmyeong
is malnourished,

00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:52.547
and this is exactly
what he needs right now.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:56.050
The broth is made with ingredients
with invigorating properties,

00:59:56.134 --> 00:59:58.678
including ox feet, velvet antler,
and <i>cheongung </i>root.

00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:00.763
Very well. I get it.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.056
All right.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.058
Queen Dowager,
feed it to the Grand Prince.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:05.435
Your Royal Highness.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:07.562
I do not trust her.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.064
If you do not trust her,

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:11.524
I will taste the food myself.

01:00:12.609 --> 01:00:13.693
Your Majesty.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:17.030
Your Majesty, it is not customary
for the king to taste the food first.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:21.743
What better way is there
to ease the Queen Dowager's doubts?

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.995
Your Majesty, you cannot do it.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:29.959
I would also like to taste the food
the chief royal cook prepared.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.879
Your Majesty, I will taste the food.

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:33.921
No.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:35.882
What are you doing?

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.259
You taste the food.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:50.897
Your Majesty.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.322
The broth is thick and rich.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.326
The natural flavors of the ingredients
are flowing through my body.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.829
I suddenly feel energized.

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.752
Queen Dowager, give it to him.

01:01:33.564 --> 01:01:34.607
Just one bite.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.408
Open up.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.545
Look.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.757
The spasms are subsiding.

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:04.387
Jinmyeong.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:07.181
Mother.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:08.808
Jinmyeong.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.397
My goodness.

01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:18.484
His pulse is stabilizing.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.777
This is unbelievable.

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:22.155
Thank goodness.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.282
I'm so relieved.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:27.952
The heavens helped us.

01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:37.587
That is it.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:39.046
There you go.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:52.977
Are you all right?

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:54.395
Yes.

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.689
The sudden release of tension
made my legs weak.

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:00.318
I'm so relieved.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:02.361
I was really worried.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.364
You have been through a lot lately.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.366
You have too.

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.828
You were ill and stressed out.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.330
It must've been rough.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.166
I appreciate the sentiment.

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:19.086 line:20%
Come to Unyeongjeong
at the nineteenth hour.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.588 line:20%
There is something I wish to show you.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:22.006
Okay.

01:03:23.674 --> 01:03:24.509
What?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.428
What are you going to show me?

01:03:28.429 --> 01:03:29.388
Well,

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:32.058
you will see for yourself.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:34.644
Okay.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.945
<i>Is it </i>Mangunrok<i>?</i>

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.239
<i>Did he find it?</i>

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:50.368
<i>Is this it?</i>

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.953
Yes, this is it!

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.122
I found it on the way here.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.293
Thank you! Thank you so much!

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:00.962
I understand
how desperately you seek this book,

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:02.505
so I will find it for you by any means.

01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:03.673
I said it was a royal command!

01:04:03.756 --> 01:04:05.675
Your Majesty!

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.094
You must have been scared.

01:04:08.177 --> 01:04:09.679
You must stay strong.

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:12.849
<i>But</i>

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:14.767
<i>what's wrong with me?</i>

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.311
<i>It's weird.</i>

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:19.605
<i>My heart aches.</i>

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.821
All that was done came to nothing now.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:28.990
It seems things have taken
an unexpected turn, Your Highness.

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.075
There is no need to be so pessimistic.

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:32.535
Once a rift forms,

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.829
it is hard to fill in.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.457
Consort Kang did her part.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.126
What do you mean by that?

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:43.921
I am saying
she has laid the groundwork well.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:47.550
And she will also see to the rest herself.

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:50.803
Let us meet in the evening.

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.346
There is something I wish to show you.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:11.824
Chu-wol.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.077
Your Grace?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.668
Your Grace.

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.756
Your Grace…

01:05:34.805 --> 01:05:36.015
Quench your thirst.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:47.985
You look a mess.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.945
Your Grace.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:50.863
Do not worry.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.532
I did not say a word.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.786
They may threaten my life,

01:05:57.411 --> 01:06:00.998
but I will not say a word,
so do not worry, Your Grace.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.375
Do not worry.

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:05.378
I will get you out of here.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.296
Right now, Your Grace?

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:20.351
Yes.

01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:24.021
I appreciate
all that you have done for me.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:25.815
Your Grace.

01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:39.370
Your Grace…

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:48.587
This is the only way

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.966
you can get out of here, Chu-wol.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:24.206
What's taking him so long?

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:25.916
It's scary out here.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.003
He always does whatever he wants.

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:35.051
Your Majesty.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.597
Isn't that a Cheoyong mask?

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.681
It is.

01:07:41.515 --> 01:07:43.309
It is said to ward off evil.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.311
It also symbolizes
long life and abundance.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.230
Are you going to dance
the Cheoyongmu right now?

01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:51.484
I am thinking of performing it
at the banquet

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.736
celebrating my grandmother's
seventieth year.

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.822
She used to very much enjoy

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.616
the Cheoyongmu I performed
when I was little.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.121
Why did you want to see me at this hour?

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:08.000
I want you to be the first
to watch me dance.

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:08.918
Me?

01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:09.835
Yes.

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:11.462
Will you watch?

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:13.005
Okay.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:16.008
Though I did watch you dance before.

01:08:49.333 --> 01:08:50.459
<i>This might be</i>

01:08:51.168 --> 01:08:52.837
<i>the last time</i>

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.631
<i>I get to watch that dance.</i>

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.971
- Who are you?
- No, stop! Wait!

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:03.222
You crazy fool!

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.932
<i>I'm pretty good with a knife too.</i>

01:09:09.186 --> 01:09:11.063
I'm a chef. It's the same thing as a cook.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.482
<i>My gosh!</i>

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:19.113
As of this moment,
the chief royal cook of the royal kitchen

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:20.948
is Ji-young of the Yeon family.

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:25.703
You're not at all
the kind of man that I like.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.709
Let me see.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.463
Hide behind me.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.424
Right here.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:40.301
There is something on yours as well.

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.809
<i>It's beautiful. Look at the colors.</i>

01:10:01.405 --> 01:10:03.657
Stay as you are. Just for a while.

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.242
Just for a while.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.036
Stay here just a while.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.666
I missed you so much.

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:26.222
<i>Was this always such a sad dance?</i>

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.906
Yi Jang-gyun.

01:10:46.617 --> 01:10:48.118
Yi Jang-gyun.

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:50.371
You bastard!

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:52.957
Control yourself.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:59.129
Your Highness, what are we to make
of his apprehension?

01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:02.716
It means the time has come.

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:08.889
Look over there.

01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:25.239
Father?

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:26.865
Father.

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:29.451
Who is that senile old woman?

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.453
She is our finishing touch.

01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:34.915 line:20%
Is she the Internal Princess Consort?

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:36.417 line:20%
Pardon?

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:40.462 line:20%
Are you saying that woman is the mother

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:42.339
of the deposed Queen Yeon?

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:44.675
That is so.

01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:48.137
She is His Majesty's maternal grandmother,

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:51.181 line:20%
Internal Princess Consort Sim
from Goheung.

01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:57.563
She had something very important
in her possession.

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:00.899
Inside that doll

01:12:02.192 --> 01:12:04.695
is the bloodstained garment

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.365
the deposed queen wore
when she was poisoned to death.

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:11.285
Your Highness.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.580
At last.

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:15.748
It is done.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.836
Soon,

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:23.839
the whole truth will come to light.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.468
On the day of
the Grand Royal Queen Dowager's banquet,

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:30.220
the tyrant

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:34.850
will lose control
and let loose his madness,

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:37.394
and the palace will be drenched in blood.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:57.414
How was it?

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:01.418
It didn't feel like this last time.

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:04.963
But today,

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:07.091
you looked cool.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.642
Oh, I'm fine.

01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:21.063
The breeze is cold at night.

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:27.152
I must ask you something.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.658
Do you still

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:37.287
wish to find <i>Mangunrok</i> and return?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.790
Of course. Why do you ask?

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:40.874
I do not

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:44.128
want you to leave.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.213
Wherever that may be.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:52.010
Do you finally believe
I'm from the future?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.473
I could tell

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.767
you were not a person of this time.

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:00.227
How?

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:02.688
The day you made gochojang bibinbap.

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:05.649
The day you prepared oat sheen.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:09.278
The day you served me <i>doenjang</i> paasta.

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:12.781
I felt it all along…

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:16.952
that you were not from this place.

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:18.996
Then you knew all along,

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:22.124
and you still mistreated me like that?

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.126
Mistreated?

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:25.544
What are you talking about?

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:27.921
I don't believe this.

01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:30.799
Just find me <i>Mangunrok</i> already.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:34.052
Do you really wish to find that book?

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:35.846
Wait.

01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:39.892
Have you not been looking for it
all this time?

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.771
I am sure I will find it soon.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.316
However…
